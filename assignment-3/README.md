## Assignment

This assignment is worth 8 points, and will be made up of 5 parts, you will find detailed information of each parts' content and instrutions in the `.ipynb` file. Each part is marked based on the difficulty. 

In this assignment, we provide you a skeleton code of linear regression pipeline. You should add your code to make the ML pipeline running as required.



The assignment should be finished with [Databricks](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/). Please first go through the [Spark tutorial](https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/47941/discussion_topics/409967) if you are not yet familiar with Spark and Databricks.

You may find some api and python library unfamiliar for you, please follow our instruction in the python notebook, which will lead you to better get start.

## Grading
We will run your code and we will test your result with a standard testing script.

Each part will be graded individually, but there are dependencies between each parts, so please don't skip any of the parts.
